# Pizza_Sales_Analysis_Power-BI
An exploration of pizza sales data using Power BI, including data cleaning, analysis, and the creation of interactive dashboards for business intelligence.
## Introduction

This project analyzes pizza sales data to gain insights into business performance, understand key trends, and identify areas for improvement within a pizza shop. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of sales metrics and customer preferences through interactive Power BI visualizations.

## Data Source

The data used for this analysis is sourced from transaction records containing order information, including order IDs, timestamps, pizza details (type, size, quantity), and prices.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following key metrics were calculated to understand the pizza sales performance:

1. **Total Revenue:** This represents the total sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. **Average Order Value:** The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. **Total Pizzas Sold:** The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. **Total Orders:** The total number of orders placed.
5. **Average Pizzas per Order:** The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.
## Analysis and Key Findings

Based on the analysis of the pizza sales data, the following key findings have emerged:

1. **Overall Sales Performance:** The total revenue generated from pizza sales during the analyzed period was **$817,860**. This indicates a significant volume of business activity.
2. **Average Order Value:** The average amount spent per order is **$38.31**. 
3. **High Volume of Pizzas Sold:** A total of **49,574** pizzas were sold, highlighting the popularity of the product.
4. **Significant Number of Orders:** A total of **21,350** orders were placed, indicating a consistent flow of customer activity.
5. **Average Pizzas per Order:** On average, **2.32** pizzas were sold per order. This is a more meaningful metric for understanding the average order size .
6. **Daily Order Trends:** The daily trend analysis reveals peak order volumes on **Fridays** and **Saturdays**, with approximately **3,500** and **3,200** orders respectively. Sunday experiences the lowest order volume at approximately **2,600** orders. This suggests higher customer activity during the weekend.
7. **Monthly Order Trends:** Analyzing the monthly trend, **July**, **January**, and **August** show the highest number of orders. Conversely, **October** has the lowest order volume. This could indicate seasonal variations or specific promotional periods.
8. **Pizza Category Popularity:** The 'Classic' pizza category leads in sales, contributing **26.91%** of the total revenue, closely followed by the 'Supreme' category at **25.46%**. The 'Chicken' and 'Veggie' categories have slightly lower contributions at **23.96%** and **23.68%**, respectively.
9. **Pizza Size Preferences:** 'Large' pizzas are the most popular size, accounting for **45.89%** of sales. 'Medium' pizzas follow at **30.49%,** and 'Small' pizzas contribute **21.77%**. 'Extra Large' and 'Extra Extra Large' sizes have a significantly smaller market share.
10. **Pizza Category Sales Volume:** In terms of the total number of pizzas sold, the 'Classic' category leads, followed by 'Supreme', then 'Veggie', and finally 'Chicken'. This aligns with the revenue share for these categories.
11. **Top and Bottom Performing Pizzas by Revenue:**
    * **Top 5 by Revenue:** The Thai Chicken Pizza, Barbecue Chicken Pizza, California Chicken Pizza, Classic Deluxe Pizza, and Spicy Italian Pizza are the highest revenue generators.
    * **Bottom 5 by Revenue:** The Spinach Pesto Pizza, Mediterranean Pizza, Spinach Supreme Pizza, Green Garden Pizza, and Brie Carre Pizza generate the least revenue.
12. **Top and Bottom Performing Pizzas by Total Quantity Sold:**
    * **Top 5 by Quantity:** The Classic Deluxe Pizza, Barbecue Chicken Pizza, The Hawaiian Pizza, The Pepperoni Pizza, and The Thai Chicken Pizza are the most frequently sold.
    * **Bottom 5 by Quantity:** The Soppressata Pizza, The Spinach Supreme Pizza, The Calabrese Pizza, The Mediterranean Pizza, and The Brae Carre Pizza are the least frequently sold.
13. **Top and Bottom Performing Pizzas by Total Orders:**
    * **Top 5 by Orders:** The Classic Deluxe Pizza, Hawaiian Pizza, The Pepperoni Pizza, Barbecue Chicken Pizza, and The Thai Chicken Pizza are the most frequently ordered.
    * **Bottom 5 by Orders:** The Chicken Pesto Pizza, The Calabrese Pizza, The Spinach Supreme Pizza, The Mediterranean Pizza, and The Brae Carre Pizza are the least frequently ordered.

## Recommendations

Based on the detailed analysis of the pizza sales data, the following actionable recommendations are proposed:

1. **Optimize Weekend Operations:** Given the significantly higher order volumes on Fridays and Saturdays, consider:
    * **Increased Staffing:** Ensure adequate staffing levels during peak weekend hours to handle the higher demand and maintain efficient service.
    * **Targeted Weekend Promotions:** Implement special weekend promotions or discounts to further capitalize on the increased customer traffic.
2. **Focus Marketing on Top Categories:** Prioritize marketing efforts for the 'Classic' and 'Supreme' pizza categories, as they are the most popular and contribute the most to overall revenue.
3. **Leverage Large Pizza Popularity:** Given the strong preference for 'Large' pizzas, consider:
    * **Promoting Large Size:** Highlight the 'Large' size in marketing materials and potentially offer bundle deals or discounts on large pizzas.
    * **Inventory Management:** Ensure sufficient inventory of ingredients for 'Large' pizzas to meet customer demand.
4. **Deep Dive into Top Performers:** Analyze the ingredients, pricing, and marketing strategies of the top-performing pizzas (Thai Chicken, Barbecue Chicken, etc.) to understand what makes them successful. This knowledge can be applied to other pizza offerings.
5. **Review Low-Performing Items:** Conduct a review of the bottom-performing pizzas (Spinach Pesto, Mediterranean, etc.) to determine:
    * **Customer Preference:** Are these pizzas less appealing to the target audience?
    * **Pricing:** Are they priced competitively?
    * **Marketing:** Are they being adequately promoted?
    Based on the findings, consider potential adjustments to the menu, pricing, or marketing for these items, or consider discontinuing them if they consistently underperform.
6. **Seasonal Marketing Strategies:** Develop marketing campaigns aligned with the peak order months identified (July, January, August) to further boost sales during these periods. Conversely, analyze the reasons for lower sales in October and consider strategies to increase demand during that month.
7. **Menu Optimization Based on Size Preferences:** Consider menu design and pricing strategies that cater to the strong demand for 'Large' and 'Medium' pizzas.
8. **Expand on Data Insights:** Further explore the relationship between order times and order types (delivery vs. in-store) to optimize delivery routes or in-store service.
## Future Improvements

Potential areas for future analysis and improvement include:

* Analyzing sales trends by hour of the day to optimize staffing and order fulfillment processes.
* Exploring the profitability of different pizza types and sizes.
* Incorporating customer data (if available) to analyze purchasing behavior and identify customer segments.
* Implementing sales forecasting to better predict future demand and optimize inventory management.
